Welcome to the **Cellular Automata Labyrinth**, where the classic tale of the Minotaur meets computation! 🐂💻✨

## About The Project 🧩

This honors project is an exploration into the fascinating world of cellular automata, implemented in Python and brought to life with pygame. Imagine a labyrinth that reshapes itself, with walls that morph and shift, all while being navigated by the legendary Minotaur, a master of this ever-changing maze.

### Key Features 📦

- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Experience walls that form, dissolve, and move, thanks to cellular automata.
- **The Minotaur's Intellect:** Behold the Minotaur, a beast of legend, outsmarting the labyrinth with his A* pathfinding prowess.
- **Python & Pygame:** A display of programming prowess in Python, with the pygame package adding that extra flair.
