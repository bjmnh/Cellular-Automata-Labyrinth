#  Cellular Automata


## About The Project

This honors project is an exploration of cellular automata, implemented in Python and pygame. The project uses cellular automata to create a labyrinth that reshapes itself, with walls that morph and shift, all while being navigated by a Minotaur guided by A*.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Experience walls that form, dissolve, and move, thanks to cellular automata.
- **The Minotaur's Intellect:** Behold the Minotaur, a beast of legend, outsmarting the labyrinth with his A* pathfinding.
